    "description":"Hi, I’m Germain, I’m 23 years old! Recently graduated in web application development at Henallux, I’ve been passionate about computer science for as long as I can remember. I enjoy both playing video games and building tools or applications, whether to automate tasks or simply bring my ideas to life.\n\nCurious and motivated, I love learning new technologies and taking on challenges. My goal is simple: keep improving, turn creativity into real projects, and share my passion for development with others."
